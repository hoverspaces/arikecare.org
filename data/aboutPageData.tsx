      "Arike is a not-for-profit NGO that provides professional home-based health care that is holistic, person centered, confined not just for the patient but extends to family members too. ARIKE’s Health care service addresses all 4 aspects of total care: physical, psychological, social, and spiritual. We institute a unique concept of encouraging community participation in meeting a patient’s health care needs. This is executed by means of a cross subsidised model, whereby sustainability of the NGO is accomplished via nominal pricing of our healthcare services for those who can afford and then, using this income, in addition to CSR funds and sponsorships, to provide free healthcare services to the economically disadvantaged. We presently cover areas under Cochin Corporation and have catered to more than 1000 patients over the past 3 years. Our nurses give home visits on their two wheelers, thus, minimizing expenses and paving the way towards sustainability.",
