    body: `In 2019, a group of compassionate healthcare professionals came together and founded ARIKE Palliative Homecare NGO in Ernakulam, Kerala, India on the principle that everyone deserves to lead a life of dignity until death. They believed that healthcare must be holistic, person centred and must not be confined to the patient alone, rather must include the family, too. They advocated for providing healthcare that addresses all four domains of physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of one’s suffering through active participation from one’s community.
    
    ARIKE is an initiative that aims to provide easily accessible and equitable tailormade solutions for Home-based healthcare services  to the public. ARIKE functions as a not-for- profit NGO and our work constitutes a concept of delivering professional and compassionate care at home and community participation in ensuring total care for the patient and family members. ARIKE was registered as a charitable trust in October 2019 and has attained 80G status and CSRI certification in 2021.

During the last three years, Arike has been involved in different aspects of caregiving and was able to provide more than 1000 families with home care- nursing care, doctors’ consultation, end-of-life care, death care, skill intense procedures such as ascitic tap and vacuum assisted dressing,  telemedicine consultations, and physiotherapy within the comforts of one’s own home. Arike has also conducted myriad palliative sensitisation programmes emphasizing the relevance of palliative and home-based care in Ernakulam district.`,
