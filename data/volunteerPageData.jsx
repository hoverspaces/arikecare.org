    body: "There is an increasing growth in migration of the youth in India in the pursuit of better prospects and quality of life every year. This has left a myriad of homes with lonely elderly trying to fend on their own for day-to-day activities. These homes consist of old people left alone to deal with chronic illnesses like diabetes, Hypertension, Respiratory disorders, etc. Regular hospital visits pose several issues in terms of monetary expenses, the presence of a caregiver, and support during prolonged hospital stays. KOODE is a community network program that enlists volunteers committed to actively partake in identifying vulnerable patients and enlisting home-based care services for these patients. ARIKE has created KOODE to strive and pick up the old lives left on the sidelines in social isolation of the fast-paced life of today ensuring they feel cared for, seen and safe.",
